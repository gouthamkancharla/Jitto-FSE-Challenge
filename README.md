## 🚀 Quick Start (in Google Colab)

To run the project:

1. **Open the notebook** in Google Colab:  
   You can upload `Jitto_FSE_Challenge.ipynb` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or drag it into your Drive and open it there.

2. **Upload the data file**:  
   Place `unrest.csv` in the `/content/` directory.

3. **Run all cells**:
   Go to the menu: `Runtime > Run all`.

Everything will execute from start to finish — no additional setup required.
